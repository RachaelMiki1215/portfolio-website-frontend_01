# Rachael Miki Buxton - Portfolio Website Front End Code

## Intro
This is some front-end code using Next.js for [Rachael Miki Buxton's portfolio website](https://www.raemibux.dev/).
Is it really front-end if I'm using Next.js? Probably not purely front-end, but Google says it can be considered front-end.
I'm too lazy to change the repo name, so let me just keep it as is.
